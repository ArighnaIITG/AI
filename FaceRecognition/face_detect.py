Read the image and convert it to grayscale.
Many operations in OpenCV are done in grayscale.
This is the CORE of the code:
- detectMultiSclae function is a general
  function that detects objects. Since we are calling
  on the face cascade, that's what it detects.
  -- gray means to the grayscale image
  -- scaleFactor: Since some faces may be closer to the
                  camera, they would appear bigger than 
                  those faces in the back. The scale scaleFactor
                  compensates for this.
  -- minNeighbors: defines how many objects are detected near the 
          		  current one befor it declares the face found.
          		  minSize gives the size of each window.
