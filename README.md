			First things first, the bibliography contains two books which I consider are the real basis
			of what the code is about.

			This part of the repository is not completely ready, but there is some code that is part of the
			utilities that we'll be using later!

	<br>
	<p>
		This part of the repository tries to explain what a genetic algorithm is and how "evolution" occurs.
		Unfortunately is also not ready yet. I'm still working in a proper representation of a Chromosome.
		The general idea is to write a genetic algorithm which input is a number and the outout is 
		a formula that generate that number just using: '0', '1', '2', '3', '4', '5', '6', '7', '8', '9' and
		operators such as: '+', '-', '*', '/'
		The code is written in java, so, so far to execute it, we must use a javac command:
			- javac Chromosome.java
		And then:
			- java Chromosome

	<a href="https://github.com/flovera1/AI/tree/master/K-means%20clustering">Clustering</a>
	<br>
	<p>
		Clustering is one of my favorites subjects in artificial intelligence. In this folder you will find an implementation of the K-Means clustering (where K represents the number of the clusters). The data for this case are points(which were generated with "random" numbers), and I did some graphical implementation, so, every cluster was visible (in a plot with a specific color). The code is really straight and simple.
		To execute it, you need to have Java installed.
		In order to compile the code:
			- javac KMeans.java
		and to execute:
			- java KMeans
		The output of the code allows you to do two things: 
			- You will have the numbers classified in the cluster in your bash
			- You will have a representation of the points (this open to the use that you give to your clusters, but in my opinion every data should be represented in a simple and graphical way, because if not, what's the point, isn't it?).
