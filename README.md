			First things first, the bibliography contains two books which I consider are the real basis
			of what the code is about.

			This part of the repository is not completely ready, but there is some code that is part of the

		This part of the repository tries to explain what a genetic algorithm is and how "evolution" occurs.
		Unfortunately is also not ready yet. I'm still working in a proper representation of a Chromosome.
		The general idea is to write a genetic algorithm which input is a number and the outout is 
		a formula that generate that number just using: '0', '1', '2', '3', '4', '5', '6', '7', '8', '9' and
		operators such as: '+', '-', '*', '/'
		The code is written in java, so, so far to execute it, we must use a javac command:
			- javac Chromosome.java
		And then:
			- java Chromosome
